                    <hr>
                    <p class='aboutMe'>Salutations! Welcome to my website, my name is Juice and I am a full stack freelance web developer and freelance fingerpick style steel string acoustic guitarist. My main focus is backend Node.js and I absolutely love working in Node.js. I am still learning Node.js however my best ability is my ability to quickly learn and acquire new skills. I am also familiar with Python, LUA and some C. My hobbies are coding, video games and music! I often mix my hobbies together and I love to code games. I am currently working on a music game involving the Raspberry Pi. I have once worked in IT and am very familiar with computer hardware. I feel very comfortable working with hardware because I once worked at an escape room learning the Arduino Uno to make puzzles. On the weekends, I am a guitar teacher and I teach a group class for beginners to intermediate guitar. My most favorite temporary job was being a debugger by being a game tester, the skills I learned as a debugger helped me tremendously in coding. Some other skills involve being an editor, community manager, moderator for Twitch streamers.</p>

                            <p>In this game I used jQuery for the first time to make an interactive page with moving buttons. Had to learn to get comfortable with objects for the first time but made lots of progress from this assignment. Learned lots of great tricks on CSS as well and had a blast styling this one. Looking to make future updates to this game when I have free time!</p>

                            <p>Basic hangman game with an Overwatch theme. Learned functions for the first time and used them in this game. Tough homework assignment but had a lot of fun making this one. I absolutely loved the way this one turned out and at the time of doing this assignment, this felt like one of the more difficult HW asignments. After finishing this assignment I started to feel a lot more comfortable with javascript.</p>

                            <p>A trivia game of my most favorite game FORTNITE! This was the first time I used timeout and setInterval in any of my games and it was definitely tough to figure out at first. This game had a lot of jQuery and was overall great practice for me. I refactored the code and adding new questions is as easy as creating an object and adding the object name to an array.</p>

                            <p>Simple AJAX call class HW assignment, learned how to use localStorage for the first time. Great practice after learning AJAX and a great assignment to try out new CSS animations that I recently learned. I recently learned of Node.js NPM so it is possible I may not be doing any AJAX calls on jQuery for awhile but this was a great to learn before I started my journey in Node.js</p>

                            <p>First group project I ever did! I learned so much about materialize from my classmates and improved so much in my coding with their help. This was one of the most memorable experiences I had at the coding bootcamp in UCI cause I felt like I improved so much with the help of all my classmates. I wish to one day to work again with them! @nmclear @nrvpatel3 @yeungpirate</p>
